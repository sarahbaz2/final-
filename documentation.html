        <h2>General Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Netflix is one of the world’s leading streaming platforms, offering thousands of movies and TV shows across 
            various genres and countries. Due to its popularity and global reach, Netflix has become a rich source of data 
            for analysis and visualization.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this project, I used the <strong>Netflix Titles Dataset</strong>, which includes metadata for every title on the platform, 
            such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Type (Movie or TV Show)</li>
            <li>Title</li>
            <li>Director & Cast</li>
            <li>Country of production</li>
            <li>Release year</li>
            <li>Rating</li>
            <li>Listed_in (genres)</li>
            <li>Description</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            While exploring the dataset, I became interested in understanding the distribution of Netflix content. 
            This led to two main visualization ideas:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visualization 1:</strong> Compare Movies vs TV Shows.</li>
            <li><strong>Visualization 2:</strong> Search and count titles by genre using the <em>listed_in</em> column.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These visualizations together help provide both a high-level overview of Netflix’s content and a deeper 
            exploration into specific genres.
        </p>

    <!-- SECTION 2: FIRST VISUALIZATION DOCUMENTATION -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>First Visualization: Movies vs TV Shows</h2>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of the first visualization is to compare the total number of Movies and TV Shows available on Netflix 
            using an interactive D3.js bar chart. The visualization answers the question:
            <strong>"Which type of content dominates Netflix?"</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>Dataset Column Used</h3>
        <p>
            This visualization uses only one column from the dataset:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>type:</strong> indicates whether the title is a Movie or a TV Show.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
            After loading the CSV file, the data was processed by counting how many entries were Movies and how many were 
            TV Shows. Then, percentages were calculated based on the total number of titles.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Count total Movies</li>
            <li>Count total TV Shows</li>
            <li>Compute total titles</li>
            <li>Calculate percentage for each category</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Visualization Design</h3>
        <p>
            The first visualization uses a bar chart created with an SVG canvas. It includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A band scale for the X-axis (Movie vs TV Show)</li>
            <li>A linear scale for the Y-axis</li>
            <li>Value labels above each bar</li>
            <li>Dynamic title and subtitle</li>
            <li>Netflix-inspired color palette (red and pink)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>
            A toggle button allows users to switch between:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Count view:</strong> shows the total number of Movies and TV Shows.</li>
            <li><strong>Percentage view:</strong> shows the relative share each category contributes to the full dataset.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When switching modes, the bars, labels, and Y-axis values update smoothly.
        </p>

        <h3>Tooltip and Transitions</h3>
        <p>
            Hovering over a bar displays a tooltip showing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Category (Movie or TV Show)</li>
            <li>Count</li>
            <li>Percentage</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Smooth animations and transitions improve readability and user engagement.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Insights</h3>
        <p>
            Based on the dataset:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Movies make up the majority of Netflix content.</li>
            <li>TV Shows represent a smaller portion.</li>
            <li>Despite Netflix’s strong reputation for original shows, Movies still dominate numerically.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>Second Visualization: Genre Popularity Over Time</h2>
    
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this visualization is to explore how the popularity of specific genres has changed 
            over the years on Netflix. This visualization allows the user to select any genre from the dataset 
            and observe the number of titles within that genre released each year. It provides an interactive 
            way to analyze long-term trends in Netflix content production.
        </p>
    
        <h3>How We Got the Idea</h3>
        <p>
            While examining the dataset, we noticed that each title includes a <strong>listed_in</strong> field, 
            which contains one or more genres. This allowed us to analyze content categories across time. 
            Because Netflix has continuously expanded its catalog, we wanted a visualization that shows 
            <em>how different genres grow or decline over time</em>. This idea is useful for understanding 
            audience trends, Netflix’s production strategies, and genre popularity shifts across years.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Steps We Followed to Build the Visualization</h3>
    
        <h4>1. Extracting All Genres</h4>
        <p>
            We began by scanning the entire <strong>listed_in</strong> column to identify every unique genre.
            Many titles include multiple genres separated by commas, so we had to split each cell and collect 
            all distinct values. The final result was a comprehensive list of all genres found in the dataset.
        </p>
    
        <h4>2. Creating an Interactive Genre Dropdown</h4>
        <p>
            After identifying all genres, we generated an interactive dropdown menu.  
            This allows users to easily browse all available genres instead of manually typing them.  
            The dropdown updates dynamically based on the dataset, ensuring it stays accurate.
        </p>
    
        <h4>3. Filtering the Dataset by Selected Genre</h4>
        <p>
            When the user selects a genre, the visualization filters all Netflix titles to find those that 
            contain the chosen genre inside the <strong>listed_in</strong> field.  
            This ensures that even titles with multiple genres are included correctly.
        </p>
    
        <h4>4. Grouping Titles by Release Year</h4>
        <p>
            For the filtered results, we counted how many titles were released each year.  
            This produces a clear year-by-year timeline of the genre’s popularity.  
            The dataset’s <strong>release_year</strong> field allowed us to create a consistent timeline.
        </p>
    
        <h4>5. Building the Line Chart</h4>
        <p>
            We used a D3.js line chart to represent how genre popularity changes over time.  
            The X-axis represents years, while the Y-axis shows the number of titles released for the selected genre.
            A smooth animated transition makes the chart visually appealing and easy to interpret.
        </p>
    
        <h4>6. Adding Interactivity</h4>
        <p>
            The visualization updates automatically every time the user selects a different genre.  
            The transition between states is animated, making it intuitive and engaging.
        </p>
    
        <h4>7. Interpretation of Results</h4>
        <p>
            This visualization allows users to explore questions such as:
        </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Which genres grew the most in recent years?</li>
            <li>How did Netflix expand into new content categories?</li>
            <li>Are some genres consistently popular across time?</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            The result is a dynamic, insightful, and user-friendly visualization that complements the 
            first visualization by adding a deeper temporal perspective.

        <h2>Visualization 3: Top Countries by Releases</h2>
      
        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of this visualization is to explore which countries released the most content on Netflix in a given year.
          I started by sketching a horizontal bar chart layout on paper, considering how to handle multiple countries per title.
          Since many titles are listed in multiple countries, I decided to split the <code>country</code> column by commas and count each country separately.
          This allows the visualization to accurately reflect which countries are most active in releasing Netflix content.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Rationale of Design Choices</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chart Type:</strong> Horizontal Bar Chart – makes it easy to compare country counts side by side.</li>
          <li><strong>Interactive Dropdown:</strong> Users can select a release year. The chart updates dynamically to show the top countries for that year.</li>
          <li><strong>Color:</strong> A consistent fill color (#1f77b4) is used for all bars to keep focus on the data rather than the color encoding.</li>
          <li><strong>Sorting:</strong> The bars are sorted from highest to lowest count to immediately show the top countries.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>How I Used the Visualization</h3>
        <p>
          By interacting with the dropdown to select different years, I was able to discover trends over time.
          For example, some countries consistently have high release counts, while others appear only in certain years.
          This helps identify which regions are most active in Netflix content production.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Evidence from the Visualization</h3>
        <p>
          The following screenshots demonstrate how the chart changes for different years. Hovering over each bar shows the exact number of titles for that country.
